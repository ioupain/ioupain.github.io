Dual Sword Whirlwinder

STAT POINTS:

STRENGTH:	Enough for Gear
DEXTERITY:	Enough for Gear
VITALITY:   Everything else you can spare
ENERGY:     0

SKILL POINTS:

Barbarian can wield 2 handed swords in one hand and swords are generally really nice to use as you have tonnes of options.

COMBAT SKILLS:

20  Whirlwind           (Main Skill)
01  Berserk             (1 point wonder - use to kill physical immune monsters)
01  Leap Attack         (1 point wonder - jump over rivers and obstacles)
01  Leap                (1 point wonder - jump over rivers and obstacles but is superceded by Leap Attack)
01  Concentrate         (Pre-requisite)
01  Stun                (Pre-requisite)
01  Bash                (Pre-requisite)
01  Double Swing        (Not strictly necessary - but useful to make getting to level 30 more palatable as it attacks fast)

COMBAT MASTERIES:

20 Sword Mastery        (You're aiming to use swords for this build)
01 Increase Speed       (1 point wonder)
01 Increase Stamina     (1 point wonder)
01 Iron Skin            (1 point wonder)
10 Natural Resistance   (I've suggested this as you don't have high end gear, you can get away with 1 point and rely on +skills gear - this buffs your resistances)

WARCRIES:

20 Battle Orders        (Absolute must - this boosts your entire parties health and mana)
20 Shout                (Boosts defense of whole party) 
01 Find Item            (Can use to get rid of corpses and find items - good on those resurrecting foes - but Gabe will get redemption which is better to remove corpses)
01 Battle Command       (Cast this first, it gives you a temporary +1 to all skill boost)
01 Taunt                (Super useful - causes ranged attackes to stop shooting and walk over to you)
01 Howl                 (Really useful to scare everything away if you're surrounded/mobbed)
01 Find Potion          (pre-requisite)
01 Battle Cry           (Good against Act Bosses)

GAMEPLAY:

Here's the order in which you cast your buffs, use echoing weapons (+warcry) on your switch slots:
1. Go to a Waypoint and gather your party around you
2. Cast Battle Command to boost your skills by +1
3. Cast Battle Orders
4. Cast Shout
5. Switch back to main attacking weapons
