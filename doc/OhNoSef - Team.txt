Hey @OhNoSef,

I looked at your team and had a go at mapping out a potential team given your current pokemon.

Criteria:
---------
- Designed for in-game, so natures are not terribly important. Also, mostly offensive moves rather than competetive/balanced movesets since status inflictions aren't needed in-game.
- Taking into account this is a casual run and based on existing Pokemon in your possession or things you can easily find.
- Covers all the major HM moves needed in the main party for convenience (never having to switch out your main party is worth the moveslot to me).
- Held items take into account limited resources, e.g. only 2x Leftovers in the game. Also the approach I've used is for held items aim to boost the type damage, so Fire type holds Charcoal - just to help you take down everyone with an all out offensive.
- TMs are used sparingly - only the ones you can buy from Celadon Dept. Store or from Celadon Game Corner are mainly recommended.
- Some of the moves on a pokemon are the same type, this is because you have to defeat a lot of fodder and for example having 2 electric moves on your electric type can give you the PP even if it's not great from a coverage standpoint.
- I've listed some pokemon followed by an arrow '->' to show it would evolve later on.
- I've listed some moves followed by an arrow '->' to show it would replace that move later on.
- You might need to play the slots a bit to buy some TMs & Held Items. Totally understand if you don't have the time or inclination to do so though.
- Some level grinding might be required.

Coverage:
---------
I usually aim to cover the following bases in any Fire Red team for in-game progression:

1. Water or Water/Ice - to handle the Fire & Rock & Ground & Dragon types (as most Water types can use Ice Beam) [HM Surf] 
2. Fire - to handle the Grass & Bug & Steel types
3. Electric - to handle the Water & Flying types
4. Flying - to handle Grass & Bug & Fighting types [HM Fly]
5. Ground - to handle Posion & Fire & Electric types [HM Strength/Cut/Rock Smash]
6. Psychic - to handle the Poison types

Held Items Available Now:
-------------------------
- Charcoal - 1000C - Rocket Game Corner
- Mystic Water - 1000C - Rocket Game Corner
- 2x Leftovers - Routes 12 and  - Use Item Finder in both tiles that Snorlax inhabited
- Amulet Coin - Route 16 gate 2nd Floor (from Oak's aide after obtaining 40 Pokémon) 
- Magnet - Held by wild Magneton (5% chance) [Use Thief]
- Twisted Spoon - Held by wild Abra and wild Kadabra (5% chance each) [Use Thief]
- Black Belt - Route 15 (held by Crush Kin Ron & Mya's Pokémon) [Use Thief]

Held Items to look out for:
---------------------------
- Dragon Fang - Held by wild Dragonair (5% chance) [Use Thief]

TMs:
----
- TM13 - Ice Beam - 4000C - Rocket Game Corner
- TM24 - Thunderbolt - 4000C - Rocket Game Corner
- TM30 - Shadow Ball - 4500C - Rocket Game Corner
- TM35 - Flamethrower - 4000C - Rocket Game Corner

Notes:
------
- Essentially, the Ground type usually becomes a bit of a HM Slave - but Dugtrio can still be useful in Battle with Dig -> Earthquake.
